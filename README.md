"As a programmer with long-term experience in game development, I recently successfully ported the Cocos2d-x game engine to the HarmonyOS platform. I'd like to share some key technical points and practical experience.

Environment Setup and Project Configuration
First, it's necessary to prepare the HarmonyOS SDK and Cocos2d-x version 3.17 or higher. In the project configuration, the crucial step is to correctly set up the interaction bridge between the Native and Java layers. Within entry/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt, you need to add the Cocos2d-x library references and header file paths.

Core Integration Code
The following is the core code snippet enabling the integration between HarmonyOS and Cocos2d-x:"

Key translation points:
#include "cocos2d.h"
#include "Ability.h"
#include "AbilitySlice.h"
 
using namespace OHOS::AppExecFwk;
 
class GameAbilitySlice : public AbilitySlice {
public:
    void OnStart(const Want &want) override {
        AbilitySlice::OnStart(want);
      
        cocos2d::Application *app = new cocos2d::Application();
        cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->setOpenGLView(app->getOpenGLView());
        
        auto frame = GetWindow()->GetWindowProperty()->GetRequestRect();
        cocos2d::GLViewImpl::sharedOpenGLView()->setFrameSize(frame.width_, frame.height_);
        
        auto scene = HelloWorld::createScene();
        cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->runWithScene(scene);
        
        GetWindow()->BindVSyncCallback([this](int64_t timestamp) {
            cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->mainLoop();
        });
    }
    
    void OnStop() override {
        cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->end();
        AbilitySlice::OnStop();
    }
}

Performance Optimization Key Points

Memory Management: HarmonyOS has relatively strict Native memory constraints. Developers need to pay special attention to resource loading and releasing within Cocos2d-x.

Rendering Efficiency: Leverage HarmonyOS's GPU acceleration features. Optimize by reasonably setting texture formats and managing render batches.

Event Handling: Override touch event handling to ensure compatibility with HarmonyOS's gesture system.

Debugging Techniques

When using HiLog for printing logs, it's advisable to encapsulate an adaptation layer to redirect Cocos2d-x's log output to the HarmonyOS logging system.

Utilize DevEco Studio's Native debugging capabilities to effectively locate issues at the C++ layer.

Project Experience & Future Plans

Through this project implementation, I found that HarmonyOS provides a stable runtime environment and delivers good performance for Cocos2d-x games, particularly showcasing unique advantages in its distributed capabilities. Future plans include further exploring the implementation of multi-device collaborative gaming scenarios.
